# Flappy-Bird-game
This repository contains the source code to the classic flappy bird game. 

I created this classic game using pygame which is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

Unfortunately this cannot be hosted since it uses pygame. But I am trying a round-about way so that I can host my program in future.
