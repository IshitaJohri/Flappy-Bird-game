# Flappy-Bird-game
This repository contains the source code to the classic flappy bird game.
Flappy bird was originally released as a mobile game where you tap the screen to make the bird fly. If the bird hits the pipes or the edges of the screen, the game ends and the player needs to restart.

I created this classic game using pygame which is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

Unfortunately this cannot be hosted since it uses pygame. But I am trying a round-about way so that I can host my program in future.

Note: Before executing the file do 
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
